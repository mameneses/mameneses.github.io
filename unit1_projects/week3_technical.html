			<h4>JavaScript: the cool kid at web development high, but why?</h4>
			<h6>4/19/2014</h6>
			<p>
			We are going to explore why JavaScript is so popular in web development.  This is a topic that books could be written about, but I will do my best sum it up. To understand how anything successful came to be, it is important to understand where they came from. 
			</p>
			<h5>A Bit of History</h5>
			<p>
			Back in 1995 Brendan Eich had the basic language design, formerly Mocha, for what today is JavaScript.  Eich worked at Netscape and JavaScript was the language for Netscape Navigator. This was when Netscape Navigator was winning the browser wars, before Microsoft eventually won out with Internet Explorer. (Yes, Browser wars, and no this is not an internet reality show on TLC) Its connection to Netscape Navigator helped to establish itself. JavaScript is a language that allows for dynamic development. So, JavaScript was already hanging out with the cool kids from the start, but JS managed to stay popular, even after Netscape Navigator took the plunge into irrelevancy, because of all of its other great attributes and friends.
			</p>
			<h5>Its Personality</h5>
			<p>
			Since its infancy JavaScript has become standardized across browsers, which means that you can use it to make a web page and your web page will likely work on most, to all, browsers. Basically, It gets along with everyone. Additionally, while being powerful and fast it has become relatively easy to learn. Like anything, it take times and practice, but the amount of information about JS and it syntax on the internet makes it possible to learn with an internet connection, time and dedication. JavaScript is also easy to edit with the help of free text editors, like notepad++ of Sublime text. While this is not unique to JS it does help to add to its popularity.
			</p>
			<h5>JavaScripts allies </h5>
			<p>
			There are numerous tools that help to make JavaScript easier to use. One great tool is the Web Developer tools that opens in your browser and pulls back the curtain so you can see what is happening back stage. This makes it easier to change code, point out what needs to be fixed, or can be improved (also known as debugging). Libraries, pre- written sets of code, have also helped to keep JavaScript prominent. These libraries, such as jQuery or Pototype, help to solve complex problems by just writing a few lines of code, savings time and making it more JavaScript more friendly overall.  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) came along and allowed for web pages to make small updates without loading the page all over again. AJAX made everything more user friends and user friendly = popular (just ask Apple).  
			</p>
			<h5>Too many words up there, give me an over simplified break down</h5>
			<p>
			JavaScript is popular for web development because it got a head start by hanging out with the former popular kid; Netscape Navigator. It has great qualities such as being standard across browsers, relatively easy to learn, and easy to edit/adapt. It has gained some great allies such as Web developer Tools, libraries (jQuery), and AJAX. There are many that argue that JavaScript sucks but its hard to argue that it is not popular.
