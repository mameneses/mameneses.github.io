	<p> When I think of times in my life where I have been happiest, proudest, or most satisfied the following values come to mind:
		<ul>
			<li>Adventure</li>
			<li>Commitment</li>
			<li>Having a family</li>
			<li>Growth</li>
			<li>Compassion</li>
			<li>Helping society </li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<p> The one value of Helping society is important to me because it is a value that I have been on both ends of giving and receiving help. I have been lucking enough to know kind hearted generous people set to help society and have helped me. Now I gain satisfaction when I feel that I am contributing to that same goal. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In general, I try to live up to these values:

	Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
		<ul>
			<li>Adventure - 4</li>
			<li>Commitment - 4</li>
			<li>Having a family - 3</li>
			<li>Growth - 4 </li>
			<li>Compassion - 2</li>
			<li>Helping society - 4</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p> The last topic that someone asked me advice for was help avoiding foreclosure.</p>
