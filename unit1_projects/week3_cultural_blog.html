			<h4>Pairing and Feedback</h4>
			<h6>4/19/2014</h6>
			<h5>Pairing</h5>
			<p>
			Pairing with other to solve challenges is nothing new and is what has allowed us to develop into the most dominant species in the world. But pairing is more than just a survival response. Pairing with others is like gaining an instant comrade to tackle any issues that might come up. It allows for a sound board to bounce your ideas off of and instant feedback with different perspectives. The fun part is building a relationship through youâ€™re the mutual struggles and mutual teaching. The difficult aspect of pairing is the vulnerability of opening your selfup and admitting when help is needed. It can become frustrating when people are not on the same page or when personalities clash. 
			</p>
			<h5>Feedback</h5>
			<p>Feedback is another essential part of pairing because it is the only true way to recognize strengths weakness and area to improve. When reading my own feedback I tend to feel appreciative and understanding, as long as the feedback is appropriate and constructive. The feedback was helpful to my learning about pairing how to improve my interactions. Writing feedback is a different monster. It is difficult to focus on the problem at hand while also thinking of constructive and actionable steps your partner can take to improve. As a very positive person I found myself give compliment after compliment while trying to find issues to point out. Maybe I just had some excellent pairing sessions and my partners were great, only time and more pairing session will tell.
