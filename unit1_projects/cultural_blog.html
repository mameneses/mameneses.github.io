			<h4>DBC Education Style and Where I Fit In</h4>
			<h5>5/25/2014</h5>
			<p>
				I would equate the DBC experience to that of the Little Giants. While we may not be a group of total misfits, we are group of people from diverse grounds with a common goal to learn a skill together. DBC fits the role of the unorthodox coach with methods that at time are unusual but effective. Yet, in the end it is up to the individual effort of each person to see how far they can take themselves. Maybe at the end of the program there will be a pizza party, who knows. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If I would describe the DBC experience in one word it would be <q>intense.</q> Packing an immense amount of information into 9 weeks of prep and 9 weeks of hands on work means long hours and uninterrupted focus. The expectations and environment add a sense of pressure, not necessarily external pressure, but an internal pressure to work your hardest. There is no mother nagging you to do your homework, you must rely on your inter drive to improve yourself. Instead of a nagging mother you have a cohort of people ready to give honest feedback to help guide your improvement. This also means you have to be ready to share your honest opinions and feels.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am ready to put in long hours and work my butt off. The hardest part for me is going to be the acceptance and giving of feedback. I am not the type to get upset or lash out, but I tend to get discouraged when I receive negative feedback. I have faced my fair share of adversity and feel that with practice I will get better at handling negative feedback. As long as the feedback is constructive and something that I can work on I will be fine, but negativity and I do not jive. When giving feedback I tend to be overly positive and may not be completely honest with someone if they are not meeting expectations. That will be the biggest challenge for me.

			<h4>Remaking My Webpage/ Blog: Day and Night</h4>
			<h5>5/24/2014</h5>
			<p>
				8 weeks ago I started on this journey to learn more about computers and eventually become a web developer. Little did I know that the first step on this voyage would be to create my own web page from scratch. My first attempt was incredibly novice, as I was a complete HTML/CSS novice. After 7 weeks of sifting through lines of code and writing my own code, things began to click and I was finally tasked with revisiting my novice site to show my skills.  </p>
			<p>
				I first revisited my old site and wrote down one note. <q> Scrap it!</q> I started from ground zero again, but with inspiration from other peoples blogs, a better understanding of what is possible and how to get there. For me it would have been much harder to work with what I had and modify it because it was far from what I wanted it to be. I wire framed a mockup and coded away. </p>
			<p>
				Once satisfied with my well improved site I sent it out into the world to be torn apart. With the help from friends and family I received constructive and positive feedback such as, <q>Maybe you should center this</q> or <q>I am not a big fan of this color</q>. I accepted the feedback with open arms and ears and made some changes to see how they looked. I kept telling myself <q>Keep an open mind</q>. I kept some suggestions and discarded others but overall it greatly improved the look and feel of my website. Normally I am a bit shy when it comes to posting my work to be judged, but this is a great step toward improvement of myself and my work. </p>

			<h4>Eating from my own Values menu: How My Values Shape My Actions</h4>
			<h5>5/17/2014</h5>
			<p>
			I am lucky enough to have parents that, from a young age, took the time instill a strong value system into my psyche. They instilled a sense importantce on education and self-improvement, as they would forgo they own desires so that I could have a top notch education and opportunities. They taught me to value my family. I still remember when I was five years old and had just finished fighting with my older sister, my father told me, <q>there is only one person who is going to be with you for the rest of your life, even after your mother and I are gone, and that is your sister, so be nice to her.</q> That stuck with me. My parents have also always lead by example showing compassion and helping others.  Weather it was my father bringing home a stray injured animal to nurse it back to health, or my mother encouraging me help my elderly neighbors by raking their leaves, there was always a sense  of compassion and benevolence in their actions. This has allowed me to be an empathetic person and to try and see things from other peoples perspectives. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I have used these values in my everyday life and they have proven to be successful for myself. When facing stereotype threat my values allow me to try and understand where the stereotype is coming from and disconnect myself from the attack, to not fall victim to it. It also helps to recognize my own situation. Instead of getting mad or flustered when I run into issues, I can often take a step back to evaluate where my frustration is coming from, which helps to clear my mind. This is an exercise that also allows me to better handle conflict with others. I try and take others perspective to see if the issue is really what is the perceived conflict or if it is another issue that is presenting itself in that moment. These values have been set so deeply within myself that it translates into how I live my life and relate with others.

			<h4>Life Outside This Box: Stereotype Threat</h4>
			<h5>5/11/2014</h5>
			<p>
			For the last three years I have been working for a non-profit as a housing counselor. On a daily basis over the phone I spoke with distressed homeowners, from all over the nation, about their hardship, financial difficulties, and how they could resolve their situation. While you would think, doing something over the phone would eliminate stereo types, with a name like Matias Meneses and being <q>young</q>  to discuss mortgages, I faced a fair amount of stereo type threat. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In my conversations with clients, I would often be told <q> Wow, you speak English good </q>. (When I actually speak English WELL) I was born, raised and educated in the United States but I was often stereotyped, by my name, to be a non-English speaker. Other times I would have people question my age. <q>How old are you?</q> . This stereotype of my younger age usually meant that they thought my knowledge was invalid or my experience was moot, even though I have faced my own struggles and have help literally hundreds of family avoid foreclosure.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I would combat there stereo types and the feeling of my blood boiling by using empathy. I would put myself in their shoes. Maybe they have not had much exposure to Latinos within the United States. Maybe media is giving them a poor idea of what to expect. This allowed me to continue with confidence and show more of myself to the person knowing that this type of exposure is what helps to squash those negative stereotypes.

			<h4>Patent Trolls: worse than Orcs, Ogres and Goblins combined</h4>
			<h5>5/4/2014</h5>
			<img src="http://chroniclesofharriet.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/troll-2.jpg?w=300&h=283">
			<p>
				When you think of the word troll you may think of a ugly dimwitted creature that lives under a bridge. More recently, with the invention of social media and the internet, the word troll has been used to describe people who saying outrageous or derogatory things on the internet to get a rise out of people and start arguments. Now we get to worry about <q> Patent Trolls</q>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Patent Trolls are persons or companies who accuse others of using their patents, in an attempt to collect licensing fees, even though they are not using the patent themselves for production or services. The patent trolls accusations of patent infringement can often be broad or unfounded. So why does this matter? Just defending this accusation in court can cost a company up to $2.5 million in legal fees even if successful defended. This is something that can kill your business. There is a reason that Patent trolling is big business, Patent trolling in 2011 alone caused business $29 billion in direct costs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This has been an issue that spans across all business but has been much more prevalent within the tech community. The issue with tech and software patents is that the legal jargon within these patents are often conceptual and not precise enough, making them four times more likely to face trolls as compared to other patent like chemical patents. While this has been a big issue for larger tech companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon for some time, they have the resources to ward off these troll while many smaller startups do not. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The good news is we are taking steps in the right direction. On April 29th, 2014 the Supreme Court made a ruling that makes it easier for defendants to receive reimbursement from the patent trolls in cases of frivolous patent lawsuits. But ultimately what this means is when you start your startup with your brilliant idea, invest in a damn good patent lawyer. </p>

			<h4>Pro's and Conflict</h4>
			<h5>4/27/2014</h5>
			<p>
			It was spring of 2009. I had arrived in Santiago, Chile three weeks early to begin my experience studying abroad where my family is from and where my parents grew up, yet this was a foreign land to me. Half was across the world was the love of my life simultaneously study abroad in Rome, Italy. We were doing a 6 month long distance relationship, having our own experience and everything was great. In my study abroad program was a number of people from different California universities and we were all growing closer and making bonds. One of my study abroad peers went to the same university as I did and even knew my girlfriend.  
			</p>
			<IMG SRC="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/t1.0-9/4712_747127034303_6559836_n.jpg">
			<p>
				One evening I got asked <q>Matias, why are you dating someone who is a B$@#?</q> I was greatly offended and immediately defended my relationship. People who did not know my girlfriend were making assumption from thin air? I soon learned that it was the girl from my university, that knew my girlfriend, who was spreading these gossipy lies, which infuriated me.
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead of lashing out at this girl I took a step back and thought <q>what would be the outcome of verbally scolding her?</q> I came to the conclusion that starting a fight between people in the study abroad group would lessen the experience for everyone, my self-included.  I began to remove myself for situations where she was involved and began to focus more on making new relationships with family and locals. By doing this I was able to defuse the situation and spread my social circle.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a sense, I withdrew myself from the situation and isolated myself. It negatively affected my relationship with other members of my study abroad group. I could have addressed her directly and asked why she was saying these things, tried to understand her perspective, and committed to working things out. I truly do not think that confronting her would have made the situation any better, additionally; I wanted nothing to do with her. I analyzed the expectations of possible outcomes, took control of the situation, stayed calm, and focused on preventing escalation. If I had to do it over again I would do the same things. 
			</p>

			<p>
				What I have come to understand overtime is that most conflicts that arise quickly rarely having anything to do with the personal relationship and often can be attributed to outside factor. This perspective allows me to stay calm in conflict and take control of the situation.

			<h4>Pairing and Feedback</h4>
			<h6>4/19/2014</h6>
			<h5>Pairing</h5>
			<p>
			Pairing with other to solve challenges is nothing new and is what has allowed us to develop into the most dominant species in the world. But pairing is more than just a survival response. Pairing with others is like gaining an instant comrade to tackle any issues that might come up. It allows for a sound board to bounce your ideas off of and instant feedback with different perspectives. The fun part is building a relationship through you’re the mutual struggles and mutual teaching. The difficult aspect of pairing is the vulnerability of opening your selfup and admitting when help is needed. It can become frustrating when people are not on the same page or when personalities clash. 
			</p>
			<h5>Feedback</h5>
			<p>
				Feedback is another essential part of pairing because it is the only true way to recognize strengths weakness and area to improve. When reading my own feedback I tend to feel appreciative and understanding, as long as the feedback is appropriate and constructive. The feedback was helpful to my learning about pairing how to improve my interactions. Writing feedback is a different monster. It is difficult to focus on the problem at hand while also thinking of constructive and actionable steps your partner can take to improve. As a very positive person I found myself give compliment after compliment while trying to find issues to point out. Maybe I just had some excellent pairing sessions and my partners were great, only time and more pairing session will tell.

		<h4> Week 1 Cultural Blog: My Values</h4>
		<h5>4/5/2014</h5>
			<p> When I think of times in my life where I have been happiest, proudest, or most satisfied the following values come to mind:
				<ul>
					<li>Adventure,</li>
					<li>Commitment,</li>
					<li>Having a family,</li>
					<li>Growth,</li>
					<li>Compassion,</li>
					<li>Helping society </li>
				</ul>
			<p> 
				The one value of Helping society is important to me because it is a value that I have been on both ends of giving and receiving help. I have been lucking enough to know kind hearted generous people set to help society and have helped me. Now I gain satisfaction when I feel that I am contributing to that same goal. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In general, I try to live up to these values:

			Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
				<ul>
					<li>Adventure - 4,</li>
					<li>Commitment - 4,</li>
					<li>Having a family - 3,</li>
					<li>Growth - 4, </li>
					<li>Compassion - 2,</li>
					<li>Helping society - 4,</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p> The last topic that someone asked me advice for was help avoiding foreclosure.</p>
