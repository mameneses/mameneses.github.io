			<h4>Learning the basics: Margins, Border and Padding</h4>
			<h5>April 9th, 2014</h5>
			<p>
			When buliding your website using HTML and CSS it is important that your don't crowd your screen and allow for an even spacing between text, the box and the rest of the screen. For this reason it is important to understand Margins, Border and Padding. All three have a top, bottom, left and right.<br><br>

			Margins: this is the section that seperated your "box", also known as a section or div, from the surrounding edge of the browser. <br><br>

			Border: this is what defines the edges of your "box" and gives your section (or div) a shape. The size is dictated by the "width" and "height" of the box, but the border is what can be styled and seen.<br><br>

			Padding: this is the space inbetween your text and the border. <br><br>

			This image illistrates these there section and their relation. (thanks to avaJava.com)<br><br>
