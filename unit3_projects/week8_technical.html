			<h4>Cloud Computing: Computing in the cloud is no longer having your head in the clouds</h4>
			<h5>5/25/2014</h5>
			<p>
			Remember back in the day, when new software came out and you couldn’t wait to run to your local computer store to buy the software so that you could rush home, take out the floppy disk/ compact disk to throw into your disk drive and install your new software. Then when updates came out you would go through the same process. Such excitement!  Well this is going to be a thing of the past because of cloud computing.
			</p>
			<p>
			What is cloud computing? Instead of software being delivered through disks, everything is done through the internet. With cloud computing nothing is stored locally, everything is stored on <q>the cloud<q/>, which is a mass of servers. This means that you do not need to directly download software onto a computer, all that is needed is an internet connection.  Most things that basic consumers use from google could be considered cloud computing: Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Reader and much more.

				What is so great about cloud computing? From a consumer’s perspective it can mean less upfront infrastructure cost, you don’t have to paying for all of the servers and hardware need to run software. From an environmental perspective you can reallocate resources for different functions as needed, which can maximize the computing power, reducing energy expenses. From a hosting point of view it gives much more control over your product and updates, making it difficult to bootleg. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What is wrong with cloud computing? This model puts a lot of faith in internet providers being reliable and cheap access to the internet, which may not always be the norm. If there are issues with the central servers, it means everyone is out of luck which can be very costly. There are also privacy issues, with large amounts of data being at risk and host companies being able to monitor or control communications. Intellectual property can also come into question, if it is put on the cloud does the person who put it on the cloud own it or the company that host the cloud? There is no real regulation on cloud computing and often the rules are made up as the industry progresses.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is undeniable is the trend toward cloud computing and the large amount of investment that is being made into what may be the future of computing.
