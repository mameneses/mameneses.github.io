			<h4>Cloud Computing: Computing in the cloud is no longer having your head in the clouds</h4>
			<h5>5/25/2014</h5>
			<p>
			Remember back in the day, when new software came out and you couldnâ€™t wait to run to your local computer store to buy the software so that you could rush home, take out the floppy disk/ compact disk to throw into your disk drive and install your new software. Then when updates came out you would go through the same process. Such excitement!  Well this is going to be a thing of the past because of cloud computing.
