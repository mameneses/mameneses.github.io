			<h4>DBC Education Style and Where I Fit In</h4>
			<h5>5/25/2014</h5>
			<p>
				I would equate the DBC experience to that of the Little Giants. While we may not be a group of total misfits, we are group of people from diverse grounds with a common goal to learn a skill together. DBC fits the role of the unorthodox coach with methods that at time are unusual but effective. Yet, in the end it is up to the individual effort of each person to see how far they can take themselves. Maybe at the end of the program there will be a pizza party, who knows. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If I would describe the DBC experience in one word it would be <q>intense.</q> Packing an immense amount of information into 9 weeks of prep and 9 weeks of hands on work means long hours and uninterrupted focus. The expectations and environment add a sense of pressure, not necessarily external pressure, but an internal pressure to work your hardest. There is no mother nagging you to do your homework, you must rely on your inter drive to improve yourself. Instead of a nagging mother you have a cohort of people ready to give honest feedback to help guide your improvement. This also means you have to be ready to share your honest opinions and feels.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am ready to put in long hours and work my butt off. The hardest part for me is going to be the acceptance and giving of feedback. I am not the type to get upset or lash out, but I tend to get discouraged when I receive negative feedback. I have faced my fair share of adversity and feel that with practice I will get better at handling negative feedback. As long as the feedback is constructive and something that I can work on I will be fine, but negativity and I do not jive. When giving feedback I tend to be overly positive and may not be completely honest with someone if they are not meeting expectations. That will be the biggest challenge for me.
