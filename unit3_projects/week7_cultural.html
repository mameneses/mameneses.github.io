			<h4>How My Values Shape My Actions</h4>
			<h5>5/17/2014</h5>
			<p>
			I am lucky enough to have parents that care enough to have instilled a strong value system into my psyche from a young age. They set a strong value on education and self-improvement as they would forgo they own desires so that I could have a top notch education and opportunities. They taught me to value my family. I still remember when I was five years old and had just fighting with my older sister, my father told me, <q>there is only one person who is going to be with you for the rest of your life, even after your mother and I are gone, and that is your sister, so be nice to her.</q> That stuck with me. They also always lead by example on how important compassion and helping society can be.  Weather it was my father bringing home a stray injured animal to nurse it back to health, or my mother encouraging me help my elderly neighbors by raking their leaves, there was always a sense  of compassion and benevolence in their actions. This has also allowed me to be an empathetic person and to try and seeing things from other people perspectives.

			I have used these values in my everyday life and they have proven to be successful for myself. When facing stereotype threat my values allow me to try and understand where the stereotype in coming from and disconnect myself for the attack, to not fall victim to it. It also helps to recognize my own situation. Instead of getting mad or flustered when I run into issues, I can often take a step back to evaluate where my frustration is coming from, which helps to clear my mind. This is an exercise that also allows me to better handle conflict with others. I try and take others perspective to see if the issue is really what is the perceived conflict or is it another conflict that is presenting itself in that moment. These values have been set so deeply within myself that it translates into how I live my life and relate with others.
