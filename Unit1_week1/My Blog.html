	<h2>Yeah,well,that's just like, my opinion, man.</h2>
	<h3> Website Design:</h3>

Mint.com:<br><br>
	This is an excellent web site to keep track of your finances and allows for easy access to tools for managing your financing and setting goals. On the Homepage, at first glance, my eye is draw to the banner advertisement just below the header. Standing back further, what most stands out to me is the one item on the page that is bright orange that allows you to see the details about the advice (also an advertisement) that is give based on your finances. Visually, I would describe with website as ordered, boxy, simple, light and condensed.  <br><br>
	This website solves the problem of tracking person finances and contains ways to link payments to categories to know where your money is actually going. Immediately after putting in your very sensitive personal information it populates content of your spending history on your credit, debit, loans and investment activity would describe the content, focus and purpose of this site as serious, informational, convenient, numbers driven and sobering.  I would say the visual and contact of the website match fairly well.<br><br>
	When it comes to navigating the web site from the homepage it can be somewhat overwhelming, especially if you have several accounts. It takes sifting through lines of information and detailed reading to analyze any budget, so the content itself lends to being overwhelming, but the distraction of embedded ads and unnecessary information , makes it difficult to see the whole financial picture. After being on this website for a while I feel in control and possible somewhat anxious depending on my spending habits. This site does not sell any products directly but does advertise for my different type of financial products, none of which I have bought. <br><br>
<br>
Footytube.com:<br><br>
	This is one of my favorite sites because it displays videos of soccer matches from every league and international game. Additionally, it provides articles and videos about the news in soccer and ranks games and goals based on popularity. On the home page my eye is drawn to the top video of the news section, as it is yellow and bigger than the other content. When I step back, my eye is drawn to the advertisement in the top right corner, which is not the most important area of the site. The website visually is cluttered, confusing, diverse, colorful and contained. <br><br>
	This website solves the problem of missing out on watching a game or a beautiful goal. It contains all of the soccer analysis and video highlights you could want. I would describe the content, focus and purpose of the site as entertaining, robust, insightful, communal, and ever changing. I do not feel that the visual fell of the website matches well with its content and it could give a cleaner feel.<br><br>
	When navigating the website is fairly easy to access the content that I use the website for, the game highlights. The Highlights are ranked by popularity and clearly list in a specific div. navigating back to the home screen is easy from any page and most of what I want to see is on the homepage. The navigation overall is easy especially due to the header that does a good break down. After visiting this website I feel happy and energetic. Footytube.com does not sell anything directly but do have advertisements for things I have never bought.<br>
<br><br>
Pitchfork.com:<br><br>
	When it comes to new music and reviews this is my favorite website to come and browse their lists and articles describing new music. When I visit the site the first thing I notice is the tile “Pitchfork” which is front and center. Even from a distance the title stands out very clearly. I would describe this website visually as clean, modern, open, deliberate, and sleek.<br><br>
 	This web solves the problem of spending too much time trying to find new music your like. Its content has everything music from new, new releases, concerts and looking up your favorite artist. I would describe its content, focus and purpose as advanced, obscure, informative, enlightening and opinionated. The visual feel of the website pairs well with its contents and attitude.<br><br>
	Navigating the website for the content that I use it for, new music, is very easy as it is located right in the header, which also makes it easy to find from any other page of the website. While it has an abundance of content it is find what you are looking for using the header tabs or search options. <br><br>After visiting Pitchfork I typically week relaxed and adventurous. This website does not sell anything directly but you are able to buy music through soundcloud.com and it has advertisement for music. I have not bought anything from this site.
