			<h4>Ruby Staying Classy</h4>
			<h5>4/5/2014</h5>
			<p>
			Today we are going to focus on Ruby classes, what they are and how they can be used. We are doing this today because ruby classes are awesome and so are you.
			</p>
			<p>The class in ruby can essentially be seen as your subject or a layout. The Class is the thing that encompasses what all of the code within the class is about. Within your class you define what characteristics, also known as variables, make up the class and what functions your class. Your class can model real life subjects (vehicles, sports teams, desserts) or anything that you can think up.</p>
			<p>For example you could have a class for mammals. The characteristics of a mammal could be defined by their name, habitat, diet, and family type. We could use this information to make a function that describes than mammal based on those characteristics. It would look like this:</p>

			<p>You can see in the first step above we are initializing the method with the things that we know (name, habitat, diet, and family type.) by making @habitat = habitat we are turning it into an instance variable. As a instance variable we can use it within our functions, also known as methods.</p>
			<p>Lets say we wanted to describe a squirrel that lived in a forest ate nuts and lives in colonies. We would want to call a new instance of the class mammal and describe the squirrel with the characteristics as show below. </p>
			<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eE26UbN48B0/U2k00_tG2YI/AAAAAAAAAHU/TqctvS6J6j0/w531-h73-no/week5_tech_class2.png">
			<p>The <q>squirrel.puts</q> above should return <q>The squirrel is a mammal that lives in a forest, eats nuts, and have a family type of colonies.</q> While it may not always sound perfect this is a simple function that can save you a lot of time. </p>
			<p>Now if we wanted to get scientific and to do quantifiable research, we could use this information to make predictions on how these mammals may affect certain environments based on the information provided using more in depth methods. The other benefit of classes is we can now use this exact same class blueprint but can make it for amphibians, birds or fish without having to write all new code. </p>
