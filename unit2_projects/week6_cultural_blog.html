		<h2>Life Outside This Box</h2>
			<h4>Stereotype Threat</h4>
			<h5>5/11/2014</h5>
			<p>
			For the last three years I have been working for a non-profit as a housing counselor. On a daily basis over the phone I spoke with distressed homeowners, from all over the nation, about their hardship, financial difficulties, and how they could resolve their situation. While you would think, doing something over the phone would eliminate stereo types, with a name like Matias Meneses and being <q>young</q>  to discuss mortgages, I faced a fair amount of stereo type threat. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In my conversations with clients, I would often be told <q> Wow, you speak English good </q>. (When I actually speak English WELL) I was born, raised and educated in the United States but I was often stereotyped, by my name, to be a non-English speaker. Other times I would have people question my age. <q>How old are you?</q> . This stereotype of my younger age usually meant that they thought my knowledge was invalid or my experience was moot, even though I have faced my own struggles and have help literally hundreds of family avoid foreclosure.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I would combat there stereo types and the feeling of my blood boiling by using empathy. I would put myself in their shoes. Maybe they have not had much exposure to Latinos within the United States. Maybe media is giving them a poor idea of what to expect. This allowed me to continue with confidence and show more of myself to the person knowing that this type of exposure is what helps to squash those negative stereotypes.
