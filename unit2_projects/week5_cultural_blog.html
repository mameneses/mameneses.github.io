				When you think of the word troll you may think of a ugly dimwitted creature that lives under a bridge. More recently, with the invention of social media and the internet, the word troll has been used to describe people who saying outrageous or derogatory things on the internet to get a rise out of people and start arguments. Now we get to worry about <q> Patent Trolls</q>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Patent Trolls are persons or companies who accuse others of using their patents, in an attempt to collect licensing fees, even though they are not using the patent themselves for production or services. The patent trolls accusations of patent infringement can often be broad or unfounded. So why does this matter? Just defending this accusation in court can cost a company up to $2.5 million in legal fees even if successful defended. This is something that can kill your business. There is a reason that Patent trolling is big business, Patent trolling in 2011 alone caused business $29 billion in direct costs.

				This has been an issue that spans across all business but has been much more prevalent within the tech community. The issue with tech and software patents is that the legal jargon within these patents are often conceptual and not precise enough, making them four times more likely to face trolls as compared to other patent like chemical patents. While this has been a big issue for larger tech companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon for some time, they have the resources to ward off these troll while many smaller startups do not. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The good news is we are taking steps in the right direction. On April 29th, 2014 the Supreme Court made a ruling that makes it easier for defendants to receive reimbursement from the patent trolls in cases of frivolous patent lawsuits. But ultimately what this means is when you start your startup with your brilliant idea, invest in a damn good patent lawyer. </p>
