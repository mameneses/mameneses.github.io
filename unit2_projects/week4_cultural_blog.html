			<h4>Pro's and Conflict</h4>
			<h5>4/27/2014</h5>
			<p>
			It was spring of 2009. I had arrived in Santiago, Chile three weeks early to begin my experience studying abroad where my family is from and where my parents grew up, yet this was a foreign land to me. Half was across the world was the love of my life simultaneously study abroad in Rome, Italy. We were doing a 6 month long distance relationship, having our own experience and everything was great. In my study abroad program was a number of people from different California universities and we were all growing closer and making bonds. One of my study abroad peers went to the same university as I did and even knew my girlfriend.

			<p>One evening I got asked <q>Matias, why are you dating someone who is a B$@#?</q> I was greatly offended and immediately defended my relationship. People who did not know my girlfriend were making assumption from thin air? I soon learned that it was the girl from my university, that knew my girlfriend, who was spreading these gossipy lies, which infuriated me.</p>
			<p>Instead of lashing out at this girl I took a step back and thought <q>what would be the outcome of verbally scolding her?</q> I came to the conclusion that starting a fight between people in the study abroad group would lessen the experience for everyone, my self-included.  I began to remove myself for situations where she was involved and began to focus more on making new relationships with family and locals. By doing this I was able to defuse the situation and spread my social circle.</p>
			<p>In a sense, I withdrew myself from the situation and isolated myself. It negatively affected my relationship with other members of my study abroad group. I could have addressed her directly and asked why she was saying these things, tried to understand her perspective, and committed to working things out. I truly do not think that confronting her would have made the situation any better, additionally; I wanted nothing to do with her. I analyzed the expectations of possible outcomes, took control of the situation, stayed calm, and focused on preventing escalation. If I had to do it over again I would do the same things. </p>

			<p>What I have come to understand overtime is that most conflicts that arise quickly rarely having anything to do with the personal relationship and often can be attributed to outside factor. This perspective allows me to stay calm in conflict and take control of the situation.</p>
