		<h2>Enumerable Nation</h2>
			<h3>What it means to be a Groupie</h3>
			<h5>4/26/2014</h5>
			<p>
			Enumerators are a great way to search and sort through collection of data within ruby. Today we are going to focus on the group_by Enumerable and its uses. 
			</p>
			<h4>The group_by syntax looks  like this:</h4>
			<h4>.group_by { |object| block} => a_hash</h4>
			<p>This basically says that what you call on group_by to sort your information you will decide how you want to group your information using the block of code and it will return a hash (a directory of unique keys and their values.)</p>
			<p>Why would you need the group_by Enumerable you ask? Well if you are looking to make groups of specific information and narrow down your search this is a huge help. </p>
			<h4>Everything is better with examples</h4>

			<p>You can see for the number 1 through 6 it grouping them by their divisibility by 3. 3 and 6 are evenly divisable by 3 with zero remainders, 1 and 4 have one remainder, 2 and 5 have 2 remainders.</p>
			<h4>But what about strings? Great question.</h4>
			<p>Lets say you are an eagerly waiting parents for your first new born and you have run into the predicament of what to call you child. You have a big list of names what was to narrow it down a bit. Group_by can help you out. Lets say you wanted to choose your babies name based on the length of the name, you want something short and sweet. You can do this:</p>

			<p>Maybe, you are dead set on having good initials, you can group by the first letter of the name like this:</p>

			<p>While these are very basic and simple examples. With good ruby knowledge you can group by number of occurrences with the array or even by a specific string. </p>
