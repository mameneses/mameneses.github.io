			<h4>Object Oriented Programing Vs Functional programing</h4>
			<h5>5/11/2014</h5>
			<p>
			Some argue that Object Oriented Programing and Functional Programing are opposites but like any tools they each have their purposes and better uses. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Here is what you need you need to know about OOP (Object Oriented Programing): It is a type of programing that have close relations between the data used and the operations that affect said data. In OOP the main actions include composes new objects and changes existing objects, or data, by way of methods. OOP, much like its title suggests, is a type of programing that is oriented towards the object it uses and creates by way of methods. A type of data defines a class and establishes how the operations will affect that data.
			</p>
			<p>
			Here is what you need to know about Functional Programing:  It is a style of programing where the data does not hold as close of a relationship with its functions. There is no straight forward definition of Functional Programming but it does have some characteristics. It is typically utilizes high order functions (HOF: takes functions as an input and outputs a function) and having minimized effects. It often uses smaller functions for a specific operation. 
			</p>
			<p>
			With this said, OOP makes it easy to change the way things are put together based on the objects of a program, which makes it ideal for programs that will be changing and evolving frequently, and where the relationship between object is important. Typically big databases use functional programing as it is efficient for treating all data similarly, while the OOP may be used to create access the data in different ways. Essentially they are not always mutually exclusive and can be combined to capitalize on their efficiencies.
